# Java Encapsulation

## Encapsulation Definition

```java
Encapsulation is a process of "BINDING" the "VARIABLES" and "METHODS" in "SINGLE CLASS"
```

```java
In encapsulation, "ALL VARIABLES" must be declared as "PRIVATE"
```

```java
In encapsulation, "EVERY VARIABLE" must have "GET METHOD" and "SET METHOD"
```

```java
"VARIABLES" can be accessed only through "METHODS"
```
